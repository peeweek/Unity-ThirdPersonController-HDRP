## Sample Prefabs

You will find some **unitypackage** archive that can deploy assets in your project : it is located in your Project window in **3rd Person Controller/Prefabs**

Once unpacked, the data will be available in your project in the **Assets/Characters/3rdPersonCharacter-XYBot** folder.

There are two prefabs : X-Bot and Y-Bot that you can use as controllers in the scene.
